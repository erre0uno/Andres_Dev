# Steps to use:

- Download the package and include the script using script tag as shown in below

```html
<head>
    <script src='./Source/CSPSH.js' type='module'></script>
</head>
```
- It is recommended to place the script tag at the end of your ``body`` tag in html.
**NOTE: Make sure to place the Source folder in this repo to your directory where your main html file is present (or) paste the exact path of CSPSH.js. But I recommend to copy the source folder to your work folder because CSPSH.js will automatically adds the css files once it is loaded.**

- In HTML define a class name with ``CSPSH`` inorder to make CSPSH.js realise the code that is written in that element(I personally prefer div tag for that) and theme attribute to either ``monokai`` or ``drakula`` or default theme ``cspsh`` to choose the theme scheme and lang is the language of the code that is written inside the tag. see the example below for better understanding.

```html
<div class="CSPSH" lang = 'js' name="fileName" theme="monokai"></div><!--Filename is optional and it will be "file" if the field is empty-->
```

- Start typing your code inside this tag.
- In the previous version you have to seperate each word by spaces which is no longer required.
- Another impovement the strings. Yes now it can detect any kind of strings with spaces wothout spaces it just highlights(if you found any issue you can create a issue).
- It has basic formatting too.

```html
<!--Example-1-->
<div class="CSPSH" lang = 'js' name="fileName" theme="monokai">
    const toggler = new Toggler;
    toggler.toggleClass('myId', 'fromClass', 'toClass');
</div>
```

# Hotfix info:
- Fixed some css.
- Organized code.

# Minor Version info:

- Created CSPSH class. visit [docs](https://the-atelier.ml/Pages/CSPSH/cspsh.html) for more info.  
- Added lineCount (Not responsive for now will make it responsive soon).
- Now user can decided if their code should show the line count or not just by defining an attribute ``linecount = true`` to make them visible and not mentioning the attribute for hiding the line count.
- Now the code will be change into code tag.
- Improved CSS, Copy to clipboard system.

# Major Version info:

- Added language suppport as said these are the language that were added but there are some keywords, types, etc I didn't add. Because I don't know all those things. And you are welcomed to help me in adding those things.
    1. JavaScript
    2. Java
    3. C language
    4. C++
    5. StoryScript
    6. TypeScript(almost js and ts are same so you don't find any extra file for typescript)
    7. C#(almost C# and Java are same so you don't find any extra file for C#)
- Optimized css. Previously there is a seperate css for every lang but I combined the styles(colors) for same colors (ex: types for all langs use same color). 
- This update covers all the previous beta and alpha update so consider this update as the latest stable update.


**Planned improvements**
- Add some more themes.
- (optional) Add light mode if requested by any.
- Add tabs system.

**Example**

```html
<div class="CSPSH" lang = 'js' name="ValidCode" theme="drakula">
    //single line comments
    /*multi
    line
    comments*/
    const toggler = new Toggler
    toggler.toggleClass ('myId', 'fromClass', 'toClass')
    var a = 1
    var b = 2
    console.log(biggest(a, b))
    function biggest(a, b) {
        if (a < b){
            return b
        } else {
            return a
        }
    }
</div>
```
**Note:**
- When user uses ``window.onload`` event in their scripts they might face some problems in functionality. To avoid that problem use the code shown below in ``window.onload`` in user's script:
> script.js
```js
window.onload = function(){
    //code that user wants to perform
    const cspsh = new CSPSH
    cspsh.highlight()
}
```
- This will automatically highlightes the code which has CSPSH as class name for more info visit [docs](https://the-atelier.ml/Pages/CSPSH/cspsh.html).

**NOTE: It is recommended that not to format the code in your html with the tab spaces its not necessary. But you must use new line(enter or a semicolon) to make it identify the new lines.**
